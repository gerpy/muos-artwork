# System artwork for any theme

There are several sets of gaming systems pictures on the web. However, the darkest pictures do not always display well on dark themes. Same with light over light. On the MuOS Discord, @joyrider3774 helped me by downloading hi res pictures for each system from [Screencraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) using the API. He has conveniently stored the results on [Mega](https://mega.nz/folder/s8oSiRBD#USPpSPL4Qzb5wgeJnVLlzg). BTW, he also helped me for the convert commands of the script.

There are color logos, B&W logos and pictures of the consoles/systems. To give an example, I will focus on [system pictures](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/system-scraping/system-pictures/shadow-invert) and [color logos](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/system-scraping/system-logos/shadow-invert).

Here are original white and black logos, as displayed on your current GitHub theme.
