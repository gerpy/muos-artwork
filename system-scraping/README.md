# System artwork for any theme

There are several sets of gaming systems pictures on the web. However, the darkest pictures do not always display well on dark themes. Same with light over light. On the MuOS Discord, @joyrider3774 helped me by downloading hi res pictures for each system from [Screencraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr/) using the API. He has conveniently stored the results here : https://mega.nz/folder/s8oSiRBD#USPpSPL4Qzb5wgeJnVLlzg

There are color logos, B&W logos and pictures of the consoles/systems. To give an example, I will focus on system pictures and [color logos](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/system-scraping/system-logos/shadow-invert).
