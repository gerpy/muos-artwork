# MuOS artwork

MuOS (https://muos.dev] is a great OS for the supported handheld retro emulation consoles. It is as fast as the fastest systems yet customizable to your needs. But it lags behind heavuer systems such Knulli when it comes to artwork. In this project, I share a couple of ressources that I use for myself. Nothing is super-polished and it comes with no warranty whatsoever. But I hope it can prove useful for other people.

The following sections are dedicated to :

1. [Scrape games with Skyscraper](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/games-scraping)
2. [Copy game text and artwork to a MuOS catalogue](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/build-catalogue)
3. [Fix system logos and pictures to display correctly on any theme](https://github.com/gerpy/muos-artwork/tree/master/system-scraping)

Thanks to people on ther [MuOS Discord](https://discord.gg/USS5ybVtDz) and @joyrider3774 in particular.
