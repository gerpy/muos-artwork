	     There are multiple outputs, not only the cover
	     The boxart is simple, without gradient,
		 but it attemps to balance the size of boxes with different aspect ratios  -->
		 
	<output type="cover" width="640" height="480">
  
		<!-- The widest boxes are N64 and SNES with 340x249 aspect ratio
		     There is a 42 pix footer on MuOS screen
			 These boxes shouldn't cover the middle text line at Y=237 (238pix)
			 We take a 2 pix + shadow bottom, and just shadow at the right
			 Thus, there is 192 height left, which is 262 wide (N64 and SNES), thus 50336 pixels -->
