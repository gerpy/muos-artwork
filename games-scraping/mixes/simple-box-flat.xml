	     There are multiple outputs, not only the cover
	     The boxart is simple, without gradient,
		 but it attemps to balance the size of boxes with different aspect ratios  -->

		<!-- The widest boxes are N64 and SNES with 340x249 aspect ratio
		     There is a 42 pix footer on MuOS screen
			 These boxes shouldn't cover the middle text line at Y=236
			 Thus, there is 202 height left, which is 275 wide (N64 and SNES), thus 55550 pixels -->
